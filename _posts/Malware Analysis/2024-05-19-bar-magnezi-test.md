# Initial Assesment

Agent Tesla is a widely-used remote access Trojan (RAT) known for its keylogging and data exfiltration capabilities, often used in cyber espionage and information theft.
In this report I will Analyze an AgentTesla Sample that was uploaded to MalwareBazaar.

The file was downloaded and extracted. Just from looking at it I noticed that Iâ€™m dealing with JS and PowerShell code. I assumed that trying to deobfuscate this .BAT file would be a waste of time. So I ran it in order to capture the PowerShell script that was being executed.
